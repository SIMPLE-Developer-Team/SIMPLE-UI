# SIMPLE-UI

## About
A simple cross-platform GUI framework for C++ window applications.  
Based on the *[SIMPLE-Graphic](https://github.com/SIMPLE-Developer-Team/SIMPLE-Graphic)* library for rendering.

## Config
This framework is a header-only project, which means no compilation is required for the framework itself.  
To use it, you only need to add the framework's include directory to your project's include path.

### Steps to Use:
1. Download or clone the SIMPLE-UI repository.
2. Add the path to the `include` directory of SIMPLE-UI to your project's include directories.
3. Now you can directly use the header files provided by SIMPLE-UI in your C++ project.

No need for additional compilation steps, making it easy to integrate into your project.
